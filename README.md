# Introduction to Constaint-based Modelling in Matlab

The attached script `Leaf_Analysis.m` provides commented Matlab code for doing
- A Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
- A Flux Variability Analysis (FVA)
- Flux Sampling (CHRR)

The example using a published model of Arabidopsis leaf metabolism. 

The model was originally published by [Arnold and Nikoloski](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24808102/) and ammended by [us](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0109-0). 

The model is provided in SBML format in the file called `Arabidopsis_Metabolism.xml`.

The following literature provides some background on the above techniques: 
- [Orth et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108565/)
- [Herrmann et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0109-0)
